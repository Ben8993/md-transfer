🧪 SonarQube UAT - Landing Page

Welcome to the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environment for SonarQube! This wiki provides a quick guide to get started with code analysis, including basic usage, setting up a project, and running your first scan with the SonarScanner.

⸻

🧭 What is SonarQube?

SonarQube is a static code analysis tool that continuously inspects your codebase for bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and security hotspots. It helps teams maintain high code quality and enforce coding standards.

The UAT environment is intended for testing your SonarQube integrations, pipelines, and permissions before deploying to production.

⸻

✅ Prerequisites

Before using SonarQube UAT, make sure you have:
	•	Access to the UAT SonarQube instance (URL: https://<your-uat-sonarqube-url>)
	•	A project key and project name
	•	A SonarQube token (generated via My Account > Security)
	•	The SonarScanner CLI installed
	•	Download SonarScanner
	•	A working codebase (supported languages: Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, etc.)

⸻

🆕 Setting Up a Project
	1.	Log in to the UAT SonarQube instance.
	2.	Navigate to Projects > Create Project.
	3.	Choose Manually.
	4.	Fill in the following:
	•	Project Key: your-project-key
	•	Display Name: Your Project Name
	5.	Click Set Up.
	6.	Choose your preferred method of analysis (typically “Locally with the SonarScanner”).
	7.	Generate a token (or reuse an existing one).
	8.	Copy the provided analysis command — you’ll use this shortly.

🚀 Performing an Initial Scan

Once your project is created and the SonarScanner is installed, you can perform your first scan.

Example: Basic Scan
	1.	Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your project.
	2.	Run the following command:

sonar-scanner \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=your-project-key \
  -Dsonar.sources=. \
  -Dsonar.host.url=https://<your-uat-sonarqube-url> \
  -Dsonar.login=your-generated-token

🔐 Never commit your SonarQube token to source control.

	3.	Once the scan completes, navigate back to your SonarQube project dashboard to view the results.

⸻

📦 Optional: Add a sonar-project.properties File

To simplify scanning, add a sonar-project.properties file to your project root:

sonar.projectKey=your-project-key
sonar.projectName=Your Project Name
sonar.sources=.
sonar.host.url=https://<your-uat-sonarqube-url>
sonar.login=your-generated-token

Then simply run:

sonar-scanner

🔍 Interpreting the Results

After scanning:
	•	View Issues: Bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
	•	Check Coverage (if configured via test reports).
	•	Review the Quality Gate status.
	•	Use the Security Hotspots feature to review potential risks.

📚 Additional Resources
	•	SonarQube Documentation
	•	SonarScanner CLI Docs
	•	Sample Projects

🧯 Troubleshooting
	•	“Project not found”: Check that your projectKey matches the one created in the UAT dashboard.
	•	Authentication failed: Regenerate your token and make sure it’s correct.
	•	No issues appearing: Confirm that sonar.sources is set properly and contains code.
